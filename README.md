## Guidelines

### Project Overview

For your final project, you will choose a dataset from a government agency and perform a comprehensive data analysis and visualization. Additionally, the final output must include the implementation of a supervised or unsupervised machine learning model. The project is divided into two parts: the Preliminary Presentation (Prelim) and the Final Presentation (Finals).

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Selecting a dataset

- You must find a dataset provided by a government agency. Some examples include datasets from the Department of Education (DepEd), Department of Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture (DA), National Statistics Office (NSO), or any similar governmental organization.
- Ensure that the dataset is sufficiently complex to allow for meaningful analysis and visualization (at least 500 rows and 5 columns). It should also be relevant to real-world problems or decision-making.

2. Preliminary Presentation (Prelim):

- Presentation Date: Prelims

#### Prelims Content

- **Background of the Dataset:** Provide details on where the dataset was obtained, the agency's role, and the purpose of the data. Explain the structure of the dataset, including variables and data types.
- **Preliminary Data Analysis:** Conduct an initial exploration of the data. This may include data cleaning, missing value handling, and summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
- **Preliminary Visualization:** Present initial visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, histograms, etc.) that summarize key insights from the dataset.
- **Preliminary Machine Learning Model:** Briefly introduce the type of machine learning model (supervised or unsupervised) that you plan to implement in your final analysis.
- **Insights:** Present your preliminary findings and discuss any interesting trends or observations.

3. Final Presentation (Finals):

- Presentation Date: Finals

#### Finals Content

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Perform a full analysis of the dataset, incorporating advanced techniques such as correlations, groupings, or time series analysis where appropriate. Ensure the data is cleaned and properly prepared for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Model Implementation:**
  - Choose either a supervised model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or classification) or an unsupervised model (e.g., clustering using K-means or PCA).
  - Train the model using your dataset, and evaluate its performance.
  - Explain your choice of model and the metrics used to evaluate its accuracy or effectiveness.
- **Advanced Data Visualization:** Use multiple forms of data visualizations (scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps, etc.) to convey your findings effectively. Ensure that visualizations are meaningful and well-explained.
- **Conclusion and Recommendations:** Based on your analysis and model results, provide recommendations or conclusions. Discuss the real-world implications of your findings.

4. Report Submission:

- Along with your final presentation, you are required to submit a detailed report documenting your entire process, including data cleaning, analysis steps, visualizations, machine learning model implementation, and findings. Ensure the report is well-structured and professional.
