## Guidelines

### Project Overview

For your final project, you will choose a dataset from a government agency and perform a comprehensive data analysis and visualization. Additionally, the final output must include the implementation of a supervised or unsupervised machine learning model. The project is divided into two parts: the Preliminary Presentation (Prelim) and the Final Presentation (Finals).

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Selecting a dataset

- You must find a dataset provided by a government agency. Some examples include datasets from the Department of Education (DepEd), Department of Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture (DA), National Statistics Office (NSO), or any similar governmental organization.
- Ensure that the dataset is sufficiently complex to allow for meaningful analysis and visualization (at least 500 rows and 5 columns). It should also be relevant to real-world problems or decision-making.

2. Preliminary Presentation (Prelim):

- Presentation Date: TBA

#### Content

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Perform a full analysis of the dataset, incorporating advanced techniques such as correlations, groupings, or time series analysis where appropriate. Ensure the data is cleaned and properly prepared for analysis.
- **Preliminary Data Analysis:** Conduct an initial exploration of the data. This may include data cleaning, missing value handling, and summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
- **Preliminary Visualization:** Present initial visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, histograms, etc.) that summarize key insights from the dataset.
- **Preliminary Machine Learning Model:** Briefly introduce the type of machine learning model (supervised or unsupervised) that you plan to implement in your final analysis.
- **Insights:** Present your preliminary findings and discuss any interesting trends or observations.
