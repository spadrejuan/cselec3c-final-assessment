    "The **Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)** is the central statistical authority of the Philippines, responsible for collecting, compiling, and disseminating official data across various sectors. Established through the Philippine Statistical Act of 2013, the PSA integrates four previously separate agencies: the National Statistics Office (NSO), the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB), the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS), and the Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics (BLES). Its primary mission is to provide timely, accurate, and relevant statistics for policy-making, planning, and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES)** is a nationwide survey of households undertaken every three years. It is the main source of data on family income and expenditure, which include among others, levels of consumption by item of expenditure as well as sources of income in cash and in kind. The results of FIES provide information on the levels of living and disparities in income of Filipino families, as well as their spending patterns. The survey aims to provide a detailed picture of the economic conditions of households, measuring disparities in income and spending patterns across various regions and socio-economic groups. While usually, the FIES is a survey conducted every three years, the 2023 FIES, the dataset used in this project, is the first biennial survey of the FIES. According to an article by Dr. Mapa in July 10, 2023, this change in standard procedure is due to respond to the clamor for more frequent and timely income and expenditure statistics, as well as poverty statistics. The results of the 2023 FIES will provide inputs to the 2023 Official Poverty Statistics, which will aid the government in planning, programming, policy formulation and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information about the 2023 FIES is that for the first time, the 2023 Geo-enabled Master Sample with sample size of about 180,000 households, which includes separate domains for Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur. Further, the 2023 FIES is the second in the series to implement the Computer-Aided Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system, which replaces the traditional Paper and Pencil Interviewing method. The use of the CAPI system eliminates the manual encoding of data obtained through paper questionnaires. It facilitates the data cleaning as consistency checks, skipping patterns and error detection are already embedded in the system. These features serve as safeguard to data quality and shortens the survey’s timetable of operations. The 2023 FIES Visit 1 was conducted July 9 to July 31 in 2023, while the 2023 FIES Visit 2 was conducted from January 8 to 31 in 2024. Attached here is link used to download the FIES dataset along with the metadata where the questionnaire is located. <https://psada.psa.gov.ph/catalog/FIES/about>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this project is found on the **PSADA Microdata Catalogue** accessed here: <https://psada.psa.gov.ph/home>. ALong with the FIES database, there are also numerous databases made open for public use with focuses on ICT, Tourism, Poverty Indicators, Wage Rates, and much more. Do note that you will need to have an account registered to access these resources, and along with the account, you will need to be subjected to the PSADA Microdata Catalogue Terms and Conditions.\n",

    "Justification:\n",
    "- We used a map to display in the graph the regions number specifically instead of the original 0-17 values which can cause confusions as there are regions such as NCR that is not numbered like region 1, 2, and so on. The region names are based on the PSA's record of 'Summary of Changes made in the Philippines Standard Geographic Code Since 2001'. In this record, the code for each region is showed by the code's first two digits. For instance, Region 9 starting code is 09 followed by the more specific place (municipality / city).\n",

    "Insights:\n",
    "1. Investment Decisions: The average rental values provide critical insights for potential investors looking to purchase properties, as they highlight regions with higher or lower rental income potential. for example, NCR has the highest average of house rent which can mean the demand for a place to stay in NCR is higher compared to other regions.\n",

    "2. Regional Differences: The visualization illustrates the disparities in housing rental values across different regions, aiding in identifying profitable investment areas."

    "Here are some tailored **machine learning models** based on the structure of your dataset and potential use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Classification Models for Income/Expenditure Brackets**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in **classifying households** into income or expenditure brackets (e.g., low-income vs. high-income households), consider these classification models:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case**: If your goal is to classify households into specific income or expenditure categories, especially when the decision boundaries are non-linear.\n",
    "- **Why**: SVMs handle complex, high-dimensional data well but may require scaling and tuning for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Clustering for Household Segmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking to **segment households** based on income, expenditure, or other factors, clustering models could help:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case**: If you expect household segments to be irregularly shaped (e.g., a group of households with similar income but varied expenditures).\n",
    "- **Why**: DBSCAN is good at discovering clusters with arbitrary shapes and identifying outliers, which might be useful for detecting unique spending patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Anomaly Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "For identifying **anomalies in household expenditure** (e.g., very high or low expenses in a particular category), you could use:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Isolation Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case**: Detecting anomalous households with unusual expenditures or income patterns.\n",
    "- **Why**: This model is effective for detecting outliers, such as households with extreme values in certain spending categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Consider normalizing/standardizing continuous features (like income, expenditure) and encoding categorical variables (e.g., _Region_, _Urban/Rural_).\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**: Start with tree-based models to identify key predictors (using feature importance) and potentially use **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation**: Use cross-validation and metrics like **RMSE** (for regression) or **F1-score** (for classification) to assess model performance.\n"
