    "The **Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)** is the central statistical authority of the Philippines, responsible for collecting, compiling, and disseminating official data across various sectors. Established through the Philippine Statistical Act of 2013, the PSA integrates four previously separate agencies: the National Statistics Office (NSO), the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB), the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS), and the Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics (BLES). Its primary mission is to provide timely, accurate, and relevant statistics for policy-making, planning, and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES)** is a nationwide survey of households undertaken every three years.  It is the main source of data on family income and expenditure, which include among others, levels of consumption by item of expenditure as well as sources of income in cash and in kind.  The results of FIES provide information on the levels of living and disparities in income of Filipino families, as well as their spending patterns. The survey aims to provide a detailed picture of the economic conditions of households, measuring disparities in income and spending patterns across various regions and socio-economic groups. While usually, the FIES is a survey conducted every three years, the 2023 FIES, the dataset used in this project, is the first biennial survey of the FIES. According to an article by Dr. Mapa in July 10, 2023, this change in standard procedure is due to respond to the clamor for more frequent and timely income and expenditure statistics, as well as poverty statistics. The results of the 2023 FIES will provide inputs to the 2023 Official Poverty Statistics, which will aid the government in planning, programming, policy formulation and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information about the 2023 FIES is that for the first time, the 2023 Geo-enabled Master Sample with sample size of about 180,000 households, which includes separate domains for Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur. Further, the 2023 FIES is the second in the series to implement the Computer-Aided Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system, which replaces the traditional Paper and Pencil Interviewing method. The use of the CAPI system eliminates the manual encoding of data obtained through paper questionnaires. It facilitates the data cleaning as consistency checks, skipping patterns and error detection are already embedded in the system. These features serve as safeguard to data quality and shortens the survey’s timetable of operations. The 2023 FIES Visit 1 was conducted July 9 to July 31 in 2023, while the 2023 FIES Visit 2 was conducted from January 8 to 31 in 2024. Attached here is link used to download the FIES dataset along with the metadata where the questionnaire is located. <https://psada.psa.gov.ph/catalog/FIES/about>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this project is found on the **PSADA Microdata Catalogue** accessed here: <https://psada.psa.gov.ph/home>. ALong with the FIES database, there are also numerous databases made open for public use with focuses on ICT, Tourism, Poverty Indicators, Wage Rates, and much more. Do note that you will need to have an account registered to access these resources, and along with the account, you will need to be subjected to the PSADA Microdata Catalogue Terms and Conditions.\n",
